# Coderbyte-Practise-Interviews
Doing the practise interview assignments on coderbyte in preparation of an actual timed interview to brush up on concepts and familiarise with the platform.

## Exercise 1 - "Arrays*: Find Intersection"

#### Note:
* **Does not work on platform**, works locally only!
    - See: The following comment in `1_find_intersection.py`:
    
            TODO:
            This works locally running Python 3.8!
            But somehow this doesn't work on the Coderbyte site - test cases and possibly running the code seems to
            do a list conversion in the background when using Python 3 - this should not be happening ðŸ¤”

###### *In Python this exercise utilizes sets, lists

## Exercise 2 - "Strings: Longest Word" 

#### Note: 

* Works.
    - See: `2_longest_word.py`.
